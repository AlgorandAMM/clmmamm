# Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker

We make modifications to an example Constant Product AMM developed by Algorand's Developer Relations team to work towards a Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker. The sample AMM code is available here: [https://github.com/algorand-devrel/beaker/tree/master/examples/amm](https://github.com/algorand-devrel/beaker/tree/master/examples/amm).

To run a demo of this modified AMM, you will need to install beaker-pyteal using:
`pip install beaker-pyteal`.

You will also need to install and run Algorand's Sandbox using Docker Desktop. After installing and opening Docker, open a terminal and run `git clone https://github.com/algorand/sandbox.git`. Once the Sandbox is cloned, start the Sandbox with `cd sandbox
./sandbox up`.
